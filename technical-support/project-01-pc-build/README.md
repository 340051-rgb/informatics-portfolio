# Project 1 – PC Assembly

**Area:** Technical Support  
**Level:** Intermediate  
**Year:** 2020-2023

## 1. Description

This project documents the complete process of researching, selecting, and assembling a personal computer. Although the computer was assembled when I was 15 years old, the research and planning phase began when I was 13. The objective was to build a high performance system that fit my gaming needs while ensuring component compatibility, system stability, and proper cooling.

## 2. Objective

To design and assemble a fully functional and high performance PC by selecting compatible hardware components, assembling them correctly, and configuring the system for optimal operation and aesthetics.

## 3. Hardware and Software Used

### Hardware
- **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 7 5800x (8-Core, 3.80 GHz)
- **RAM:** 32 GB (2 x 16 GB)
- **Storage:** 1 TB M.2 NVMe SSD
- **Motherboard:** ASUS ROG B550-F Gaming WiFi
- **Cooling:** Cooler Master MasterLiquid ML240R (Liquid Cooling) 

### Software
- **Operating System:** Windows 10

## 4. Process

1. Researched the purpose and function of each computer component and its role in overall system performance.  
2. Selected hardware components based on compatibility, performance requirements, and future upgrade potential.  
3. Verified motherboard, CPU, and RAM compatibility using manufacturer documentation.  
4. Assembled the computer, starting with the motherboard, CPU, RAM, and storage.  
5. Installed the liquid cooling system, ensuring correct orientation and secure mounting.  
6. Installed the graphics card and verified physical clearance and airflow.  
7. Connected all internal cables, including power, data, and cooling connections.  
8. Managed unused cables and RGB controllers to improve airflow and aesthetics.  
9. Installed Windows 10 and performed the initial system configuration.

## 5. Challenges and Solutions

- **Component Compatibility**  
  Understanding the compatibility between the CPU, motherboard, and RAM required extensive research using technical documentation and compatibility lists.

- **BIOS Update Confusion**  
  I initially attempted to update the BIOS, later realizing the motherboard already supported the CPU version. This helped me understand the importance of verifying system requirements before performing firmware updates.

- **Liquid Cooling Installation**  
  Installing the liquid cooling system was challenging due to mounting complexity and space management. This was resolved by carefully following the manufacturer’s instructions and testing different cable routing options.

- **Cable Management and RGB Synchronization**  
  Organizing cables for optimal airflow and aesthetics, as well as synchronizing RGB lighting, required troubleshooting both hardware connections and software configurations.

## 6. Results

- Successfully assembled a fully functional and stable personal computer that I have used daily since 2023.  
- Achieved efficient cooling and optimized airflow.  
- The system operated reliably with Windows 10 and was later upgraded to Windows 11, supporting high performance tasks.


## 7. What I Learned

- Hardware component functionality and compatibility  
- System assembly and troubleshooting  
- BIOS awareness and firmware considerations  
- Cable management and thermal management  
- Problem-solving through technical documentation

## 8. Evidence

### Notes

This project represents my first complete hands-on experience with computer hardware and laid the foundation for my continued interest in technical support, systems, and informatics.
